HIVE MANUAL
# 🐝 HIVE v1.8: Industrial Distributed AI Cluster
> **"Built with the steel-like rigidity of BASIC. Evolved for Resilient AI Operations."**

This document provides the full command set for deploying and managing the HIVE v1.8 infrastructure. HIVE is designed for high-availability AI inference in secure intranet environments.

---

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

- **QUEEN (Primary Command):** Handles external API requests and worker load balancing.
- **CELL (Backup Command & Log):** Records all telemetry. Automatically assumes command if Queen fails.
- **DRONE (Worker):** Self-registering AI execution node.

---

DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS (Git & Setup)

### [A] First-time Repository Setup
```bash
# Initialize and push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Release: HIVE v1.8 Commercial Grade"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [YOUR_REPO_URL]
git push -u origin main

Environment Synchronization
Run this on every new machine to install required components:
python fabricator.py

RUNTIME COMMAND SET (Execution)
Run these commands in order to ensure stable cluster synchronization.

Step 1: Start the Primary Controller (Queen)
# Run on the Master Machine
python queen.py

Step 2: Start the Backup & Logger (Cell)
# Run on the Storage/Secondary Machine
python cell.py

Step 3: Launch the Swarm (Drones)
# Run on GPU-equipped Machines (Assign different ports if on same machine)
python drone.py 8081
python drone.py 8082

INTEGRITY & FAILOVER TESTING
[A] External API Bridge Test
Verify if the HIVE is reachable from external Web/App servers:
curl -X POST http://[QUEEN_IP]:8000/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "HIVE Connectivity Test", "max_tokens": 50}'

[B] Critical Failover Test (Resilience Check)
Simulate a command center failure to verify the Cell node's takeover:

Terminate queen.py (Ctrl+C).

Monitor cell.py terminal for: "🚨 ALERT: Queen Offline. Cell assuming Command..."

Verify that the External API now responds via http://[CELL_IP]:9000/v1/chat/completions.
